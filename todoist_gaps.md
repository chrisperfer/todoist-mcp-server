## Missing Functionality

- **Task Organization**: 
  - No way to verify section assignments in a structured way
  - No easy way to view section hierarchy and task distribution 
- **Project Organization Tools**:
  - No template system for common project structures (e.g., health project sections, work project layouts)
  - Missing project analysis tools:
    - Task distribution across sections
    - Due date clustering
    - Priority distribution
    - Label usage patterns
  - No way to clone/duplicate project structure (sections without tasks)
  - No tools for suggesting task categorization based on content or patterns
- **Visualization and Reporting**:
  - No visual representation of project structure
  - Missing task distribution charts
  - No reporting on project organization health
  - No way to compare project structures
- **Smart Organization Features**:
  - No AI-assisted task categorization
  - Missing pattern recognition for task organization
  - No automatic section suggestions based on task content
  - No tools for identifying tasks that might be miscategorized
  - No automatic priority suggestions based on due dates and task patterns
- **Bulk Operations**:
  - No mass priority updates
  - No bulk due date adjustments
  - Missing tools for reorganizing multiple projects simultaneously
  - No way to apply consistent structure across multiple projects
  - No tools for merging or splitting sections 
  - Section creation tool (add-section.js) needs improvement:
    - Better error handling
    - Clearer parameter documentation
    - Support for creating multiple sections at once 
- **API Inconsistencies**:
  - Section handling differs between REST API and Sync API:
    - REST API's `getSections()` sometimes fails to return sections that exist
    - Sync API correctly handles section operations with section IDs
    - Need to consider using Sync API more consistently for section operations
    - Current workaround: Skip section validation and rely on section IDs from task data
  - No unified approach for section operations across the codebase
