## Missing Functionality

- **Task Organization**: 
  - No way to verify section assignments in a structured way
  - No easy way to view section hierarchy and task distribution 
- **Project Organization Tools**:
  - No template system for common project structures (e.g., health project sections, work project layouts)
  - Missing project analysis tools:
    - Task distribution across sections
    - Due date clustering
    - Priority distribution
    - Label usage patterns
  - No way to clone/duplicate project structure (sections without tasks)
  - No tools for suggesting task categorization based on content or patterns
- **Visualization and Reporting**:
  - No visual representation of project structure
  - Missing task distribution charts
  - No reporting on project organization health
  - No way to compare project structures
- **Smart Organization Features**:
  - No AI-assisted task categorization
  - Missing pattern recognition for task organization
  - No automatic section suggestions based on task content
  - No tools for identifying tasks that might be miscategorized
  - No automatic priority suggestions based on due dates and task patterns
- **Bulk Operations**:
  - No mass priority updates
  - No bulk due date adjustments
  - Missing tools for reorganizing multiple projects simultaneously
  - No way to apply consistent structure across multiple projects
  - No tools for merging or splitting sections 
  - Section creation tool (add-section.js) needs improvement:
    - Better error handling
    - Clearer parameter documentation
    - Support for creating multiple sections at once 
- **API Inconsistencies**:
  - Section handling differs between REST API and Sync API:
    - REST API's `getSections()` sometimes fails to return sections that exist
    - Sync API correctly handles section operations with section IDs
    - Need to consider using Sync API more consistently for section operations
    - Current workaround: Skip section validation and rely on section IDs from task data
  - No unified approach for section operations across the codebase 

## Project Management Gaps

1. Project Creation:
   - ‚úÖ Changed add-project.js to use --parentId instead of name matching
   - Need to add validation for color values and other parameters
   - Consider adding support for bulk project creation

2. Project Deletion:
   - Missing delete-project.js tool
   - Need ability to delete projects by ID
   - Consider safety checks (e.g., confirmation for non-empty projects)

3. Project Updates:
   - Current update-project.js uses loose name matching
   - Should be updated to use exact IDs like add-project.js
   - Need better error messages for API failures

4. General Project Tool Improvements:
   - Add consistent parameter naming (e.g., projectId vs project_id)
   - Add validation for all project parameters
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Add support for bulk operations 

## Gaps Found During Elaboration Testing

1. Label Removal Issues
   - Current tools don't provide a reliable way to remove labels from tasks
   - Need to add functionality to remove labels from individual tasks
   - Consider adding a `--clear-labels` option to the task update command

2. Batch Add Improvements Needed
   - Some tasks are duplicated when adding multiple tasks with URLs
   - Need to improve handling of special characters and URLs in batch-add
   - Consider adding validation to prevent duplicate task creation

3. Task Cleanup
   - No easy way to delete duplicate tasks
   - Consider adding a batch-delete command for cleaning up tasks
   - Could use filters to identify and remove duplicates 

## Gaps Found During Batch Labeling Testing

1. Search Term Limitations
   - Complex search terms with special characters (e.g., "Home & Furniture") fail with 400 errors
   - Multiple search terms in batch-label sometimes fail to find tasks that exist
   - Need better handling of spaces and special characters in search queries

2. Label Application Verification
   - No easy way to verify all tasks that should have a label actually received it
   - No tool to show tasks grouped by label for quick verification
   - Missing functionality to show "unlabeled" tasks in a project

3. Smart Labeling Features
   - No way to suggest labels based on task content or categories
   - Category headers (e.g., "üè† Home & Furniture") could automatically suggest labels for contained tasks
   - No bulk labeling based on task relationships (e.g., label all tasks in a category)

4. Label Management
   - No way to see label distribution within a project
   - Missing tools to identify inconsistent labeling patterns
   - No way to batch modify or replace labels (e.g., replace one label with another)

## API Migration Needs

Current tools still using REST API that need migration to Sync API:

1. Project Management Tools:
   - list-projects.js: Basic project listing
   - add-project.js: Project creation
   - update-project.js: Project updates
   - move-project.js: Project hierarchy management
   Benefit of migration: Better batch operations and more reliable project hierarchy management

2. Section Management Tools:
   - list-sections.js: Section listing
   - add-section.js: Section creation
   - remove-section.js: Section deletion
   Benefit of migration: More reliable section operations, consistent with task.js approach

3. Label Management:
   - list-labels.js: Label listing
   Benefit of migration: Consistent API usage across all label operations

4. Task Listing Tools:
   - list-tasks.js: Basic task listing
   - search.js: Task searching
   Benefit of migration: Better filtering capabilities and consistent data structure

Reasons for Migration:
- Sync API provides more reliable section handling
- Better support for batch operations
- More consistent behavior across operations
- Richer filtering capabilities
- Better performance for bulk operations
- Reduced API calls for complex operations
- More reliable real-time state management

Migration Priorities:
1. Section management tools (highest priority due to known issues)
2. Project management tools (to support batch operations)
3. Task listing tools (for better filtering)
4. Label management (for consistency)

Implementation Notes:
- Each tool will need to be updated to use sync commands
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Should add proper error handling for sync-specific issues
- Consider adding batch operation support where applicable
- Update documentation to reflect Sync API usage
